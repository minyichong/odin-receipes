        <h1> Easy Zucchini Noodles with Homemade Chili Oil </h1>
        <p> Zucchini was my choice of vegetable at the time because summer zucchini and squash
            is currently in season. YOu can switch/add vegetables as you like such as carrots, kale,
            asparagus, brocolli or cabbage,etc. </p>
        <p> For noodles, I used somen, which is also called wheat noodles. 
        If you want to make it gluten-free, you can use rice noodles. It will be as delicious! </p>
